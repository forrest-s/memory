# Memory Game Project

## Memory Game
A browser-based multiplayer card-matching game.

## Project Description
The Memory Game is a fun and engaging web-based card-matching game that supports up to four players. Each player takes turns flipping cards to find matching pairs. The player with the most matches wins the game. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for game logic, CSS for styling, and HTML for structure.

### Features:
- Interactive gameplay for 2-4 players.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Visual cues for matched pairs with player-specific colors.
- Reset functionality to start a new game.

### Why This Project?
This project was built to explore JavaScript DOM manipulation, responsive design, and interactive UI development. It also serves as a great starting point for beginners to learn about grid-based layouts and event-driven programming.
